# pandas-vs-polars 

Polars built using RUST, unlike pandas which often requires the apply function iterating over each and every row in a dataframe. Polads optimizes such operations more effectively handling operation concurrently instead of one after another. Polars works both eager and lazy while by default pandas works eager. 
Apache Arrow underlies Polars. its an open source framework known for its fast data processing and support across different programming languages. 
### Core Features of Polars 
* High-speed data processing 
* efficient memory management 
* Concurrent processing
